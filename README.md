# Mystery Word Guess Game
Assignment #3 - UW Coding Bootcamp

##Game Summary##

1. The Mystery Word Guess Game is a Hangman game variant. 

2. The computer selects a random word from a list of possible "mystery" words. The user has 10 guesses to select every letter in the word and unveil the correct answer. Duplicate and correct guesses do not count against the 10 total guesses; only incorrect guesses will sacrifice one of the 10 guesses.

3. The "start" button begins a game. The "Reset" button clears all variables and counts and resets the win/loss count.
