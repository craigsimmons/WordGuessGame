Link to Max CDN for bootstrap 4 

N.B. - Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 4 from MaxCDN when visiting another site. 
As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. 
 Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be 
 served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.

    <!--
jQuery and Popper?
Bootstrap 4 uses jQuery and Popper.js for JavaScript components (like modals, tooltips, popovers etc). 
However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need them.
-->

    <!--
These features require use of Popper.js and jQuery:

Closable alerts
Buttons and checkboxes/radio buttons for toggling states
Carousel for slides, controls, and indicators
Collapse for toggling content
Dropdowns (also requires Popper.js for perfect positioning)
Modals (open and close)
Navbar (for collapsible menus)
Tooltips and popovers (also requires Popper.js for perfect positioning)
Scrollspy for scroll behavior and navigation updates
