3: create a click event
    3.1: check if the letter pressed is part of the word
    3.2: if it is in the word multiple times
    3.3: if the user has already guessed this letter
        - if the letter is part of the word then do not reduce totalGuesses
        - display the letter instead of the dash
    3.4: if user guess is not part of the word
        : if user has not already guessed the letter
            -reduce the total guesses
            - add the letter to letters guessed
            -alert the user to try again
4: Keep doing this logic if the totalGuesses is greater than 0
    : if it's less than 0, end the game. ask user if they want to play again
    : if yes, reset game
